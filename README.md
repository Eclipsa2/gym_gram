## User stories
Our team has come up with 10 user stories:
1. **Pierre, 20:** I'm a student and with so much work to do I keep losing track of my gym progress. I wish I could just log my progress so I won't forget where I'm at with my gym journey because I'm too busy studying.
2. **Virgil, 22, works at Flanco:** I finally feel satisfied with my body and that I can finally show it and be proud about my improvement. I wish there was an app where I can share my glowup with my friends and see theirs too so I can have more motivation.
3. **Nichita, 18:** I'm a gym newbie and I don't have any friends with any fitness knowledge and the online advices aren't trustworthy. I wish I could see some real-time workout routines from people with a good phisique and save them so I can always do them when I go to the gym.
4. **Scovearga, 45, CEO @ Luca:** I'm a fitness enjoyer with 3 years experience. I get a lot of questions about my workout rutines, how I got in shape etc. I wish I could just share my routine with my close friends instead of replying to all of them individually. I am a busy person after all.
5. **Mihnea, 60, elder:** The days I was writing my progress in a journal are long gone. Technology is a part of us, nowadays, thus having an app to save my workouts and PRs is now a must have in every gym rats arsenal of tools. A simple UI, that everyone can get the hang of it, even old guys such as me could use, would be a perfect fit.
6. **Andreea, 36, engineer:** I work at a job which requires minimum physical activity, so in the last few years I put some weight. I would love a gym app which could keep me motivated, by viewing other people transformation stories and progress.
7. **Adrian, 24, personal trainer:** I am a personal trainer and an app in which I could be creating exact workouts I can send to my clients for the days I can’t be training them would be perfect. Also it would be way more easier for my online clients to just send them a photo of the whole workout with exact weights and number of reps rather than writing them huge messages.
8. **Andra, 20, student:** I would want to hit the gym but I have no idea what workouts I should be doing and I am a broke college student so I can’t afford a personal trainer. An app that offers workouts as inspiration for what I should be doing in the gym is a really cool idea.
9. **Flavian, 33, dad of two:** As a busy working parent, I want to be able to access quick and effective workout routines that I can do at home or on-the-go, so that I can maintain my fitness despite my busy schedule.
10. **Florian, 26, athlete:** I want to be able to track my progress and see how I'm performing compared to others in my sport, so that I can stay motivated and continue to improve my performance.

## Bug reporting
Our team has encountered the following bugs:
1. At the start of the development, we oversaw the fact that the normal keyboard would appear when adding the weight number or set number. Fixed issue by only showing the numpad keyboard. To see the full issue click [here](https://github.com/Eclipsa2/gym_gram/issues/1).
2. The moment when you were adding a new workout, its number would not increase. The problem was with the get function, where it only took the number of workouts once, and would never update it. To see the full issue click [here](https://github.com/Eclipsa2/gym_gram/issues/2).
